# `weathercan` and Shiny

This app demonstrates how data downloaded via `weathercan` can be explored through 
a Shiny app.

You can view this exact app live here: <https://steffilazerte.shinyapps.io/weathercan_shiny/>

Alternatively, you can modify the data and display by playing around with the
code in this repository.

The data is prepared in `get_data.R` with the following packages:
```r 
install.packages("weathercan", "dplyr", "stringr", "sf", "janitor",
                 "rnaturalearth")
```

The shiny app relies on the following packages:

```
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "leaflet", 
                   "sf", "glue", "DT", "ggiraph"))
```
